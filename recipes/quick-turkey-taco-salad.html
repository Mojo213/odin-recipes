    <h1>Quick Turkey Taco Salad</h1>
    <img src="../images/turkey.JPG" alt="succulent ground turkey and hard shell tacos with avocado, jalapenos

    <h2>Description</h2>
    This is a great, fast recipe for those nights that you have little time but want a balanced meal. 
    Add beans or olives, if that is what you like. We can't find taco salad shells here, 
    so if you have them where you are, try those. If you don't like raw onions, cook the onions 
    with the ground turkey.
